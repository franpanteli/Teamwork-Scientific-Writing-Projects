# Teamwork-Scientific-Writing-Projects

This repository contains two coursework publications I produced when working in a team with other Physics students. These examples of scientific writing were created when we were assigned a set of questions to research and answer on a topic. This involved assigning team members a question, researching answers and combining our responses into a coherent narrative within a timeframe. This required the use of LaTeX for one example, and shared documents in Word for another. The abstracts for each of these projects are below. Individual contributions are listed as part of these publicationa.  

*Discrete Symmetry Theory & Applications abstract:*

This follow-up report begins with an in-depth discussion of both theory
and findings from the Wu and Fitch-Cronin experiments, which proved
P (parity) and CP (charge-parity) violation respectively. The observable
symmetry breaking on a local and universal scale are explored. The report
culminates on discussion of Sakharovâ€™s baryogenesis conditions proposed
for matter-antimatter asymmetry and suggests a potential theoretical explanation to this phenomenon.

*Our Daily Dose of Radiation abstract:*

Radiation refers simply to energy in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves.
In this project our primary concern is with ionizing radiation, radiation of high
enough energy to liberate orbital electrons from atomic nuclei. This is predominant
in the discussion of radiation and human beings because of the effects of radiation
on living tissue through cell damage, free radicals and the impairment of DNA to
reliably replicate itself leading to cancer.
In this project we will explore the daily human experience of radiation from how we
measure radiation empirically and theoretically where it comes from and in what
quantities, its physiological effects on humans at the limits of our tolerance and how
we protect ourselves from it.
